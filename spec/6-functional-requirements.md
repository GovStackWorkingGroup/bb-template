# 6 Functional Requirements

{% hint style="success" %}
The functional requirements section lists the technical capabilities that this building block should have. These requirements should be sufficient to deliver all functionality that is listed in the Key Digital Functionalities section.

These functional requirements do not define specific APIs - they provide a list of information about functionality that must be implemented within the building block.

These requirements should be defined by subject-matter experts and donâ€™t have to be highly technical in this section.

The requirements can be shown in table format. Multiple tables can be used to show different functional areas for the Building Block
